<p>This portfolio contains documents produced from two projects I've worked on - one project with the UC CubeCats and one poject with GE Aviation. See below for a short explanation of each.</p>

<p>As President of the UC CubeCats, part of my job is to plan and carry out development of our CubeSat missions. Since the UC CubeCats is a student-lead organization, it is difficult for us to attain research grants. Therefore, we have to get creative with funding. We have decided to launch a KickStarter campaign to fund our first CubeSat mission. This KickStarter campaign will present backers with three different mission options they can vote on if they back the project. Whichever CubeSat mission gets the majority of the votes is the CubeSat we build and launch. In order to narrow down our original CubeSat ideas and bring them to an acceptable level for Mission Concept Review, I created a Mission Concept Instructional Document based off of my knowledge of CubeSats and systems engineering to help UC CubeCats members develop their own CubeSat missions.</p>

<p>Next to fuel consumption, aircraft engine maintenance is one of the most costly issues airlines face. Maintenance events can delay flights, drive engine removal, and cause aborted takeoffs. In order to better understand the durability of the LEAP Engine, I assisted the LEAP Product Support Engineering Time-On-Wing Focal with creating an engine level statistical model of engine reliability. The presentation contained within my portfolio was the final presentation I created for the project during my co-op rotation at GE Aviation in the fall of 2016.</p>
